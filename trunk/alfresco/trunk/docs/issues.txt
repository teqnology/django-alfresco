Issues

 * Hierarchy-specific feeds are not functional in this release
 * Slug-based static content links have not been implemented yet
 * Group sync between Alfresco and Django has not been implemented
 * Site Map is broken
 * CMIS is a work-in-progress
 * The "Search" link next to the Doc ID field on the Static Content admin page is not functional
 * Persisting Django form data to Alfresco. Right now the sample site is all one-way. Would be nice to show some form data being persisted to Alfresco.
