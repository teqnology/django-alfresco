 * Hierarchy-specific feeds are not functional in this release
 * Slug-based static content links have not been implemented yet
 * Group sync between Alfresco and Django has not been implemented
 * Site Map is broken
 * CMIS is a work-in-progress
 * The "Search" link next to the Doc ID field on the Static Content admin page is not functional
 * Persisting Django form data to Alfresco. Right now the sample site is all one-way. Would be nice to show some form data being persisted to Alfresco.
 * In general, there is way too much reliance on doc ID's. We should have a goal to make it possible to assemble the sample site without cutting-and-pasting a single doc ID.
 * Need to make content moves in Alfresco less impactful on the Django objects. (We shouldn't be storing paths and QNames, for example).

If you find issues or have ideas for enhancements, we want to hear from you. Please log issues at the `Google Code site for django-alfresco <http://code.google.com/p/django-alfresco/issues/list>`_.
