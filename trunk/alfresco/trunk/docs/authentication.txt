Authentication
==============

If you have NOT changed your Alfresco admin login, Django will use the default 
"admin/admin" credentials to establish a ticket. It will also create a 
corresponding user in Django with the same user and password, and will mark the
account as Django Superuser and Staff.

If you HAVE changed your password, or you have disabled the "admin" account, a
login will be presented. Log in with a valid Alfresco username and password. A
corresponding user entry in Django will be created. If the username is "admin" 
it will be marked as Superuser and Staff.

You can log out at any time by browsing to:
`http://localhost:8000/alfresco/logout <http://localhost:8000/alfresco/logout>`_

The login URL is:
`http://localhost:8000/alfresco/login <http://localhost:8000/alfresco/logout>`_
